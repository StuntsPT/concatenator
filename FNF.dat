FASTA to Nexus to FASTA Converter help:

This function is rather simple:
Simply select the input and output files from the File menu. The program will automatically recognize the file format and the perform the adequate conversion.
Do not forget to select the "Missing" and "Gap" parameters and if you want to include a Taxa Block when converting from FASTA to Nexus.
The "interleave" Nexus output will divide a sequence in 5 blocks of 20 bases each for line.
When converting from Nexus to FASTA, the input file can be both "leave" or "interleave".
It is recomended that the input files are conveniently aligned (eg. all sequences have equal length). Altough the conversion #MIGHT# work on unaligned files, it has not been troughly tested and may produce unexpected results.
Also do not forget to set the data type of the file you are converting (DNA, RNA, Nucleotide or Protein data).
