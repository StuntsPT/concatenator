This function is used to "join" 2-5 Nexus formated matrices in a single "interleave" Nexus file.
The inputs must be Nexus files and can be on either "leave" or "interleave" format. A combination of both formats is also possible.
All taxa names must be the same and in the same order in all the input files.
Concatenated matrices can be used as inputs in order to add more then 5 matrices, however, concatenated matrices used as inputs will wield a less specific result (in the partitions data).
Do not forget to select a "Missing" and a "Gap" parameter, you will get a reminder (error) if you don't.
It is also possible to add a taxa block to the concatenated matrix, should you require it.
If you want to run a ILD Partition test on PAUP, there is an option that will set the preparation commands for you. The filename will be changed to have "ILD" in the end.
Do not forget to set the datatype for all the input matrices!
